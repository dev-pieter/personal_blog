I created this blog just to document, and share my findings throughout my Software Engineering career. One of the purposes of having this blog is actually to force myself to learn more, and explore new areas in software as a whole. So I hope you enjoy these articles and find them helpful.

Some more about me:

- ðŸš€ I'm an aspiring software engineer always eager to learn
- ðŸŽ“ Proficient in: JavaScript, C++, C#, Python, SQL, Mongo
- â˜• I like my Java serverd in a cup, not strongly typed.

> Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out.

Please contact me if you have any ideas for posts or tutorials that you would like to see. Also feel free to just send me an email to chat about software and the wonders of this industry. **[pieter_nortje@outlook.com](mailto:pieter_nortje@outlook.com)**
